    'weather': nws + openweather + indoor_detection, # Comprehensive weather
    'injuries': official + community + beat_writers,  # Multiple injury sources
    'team_stats': nfl_data_py + espn,              # Cross-validated stats
    'standings': espn + nfl_official               # Real-time standings
}
```

## Data Volume Achieved

- **Real-time updates**: Live game data during NFL season
- **Weather context**: Outdoor game conditions for better predictions
- **Official sources**: NFL.com and ESPN for authoritative data

### Performance Enhancements
- **Intelligent caching**: Redis-based with source-specific TTL
- **Parallel collection**: Simultaneous data fetching
- **Graceful degradation**: Fallback to core sources if enhanced sources fail
- **Rate limiting**: Respectful API usage

### Cost Efficiency
- **$0 monthly cost**: All sources use free tiers
- **No API keys required**: Core functionality works immediately
- **Optional upgrades**: Can add paid features (OpenWeatherMap API key) for enhanced weather

## Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Data Collection
```python
from data_pipeline import NFLDataPipeline

# Initialize with enhanced sources
config = {'openweather_api_key': None}  # Optional
pipeline = NFLDataPipeline(config)

# Get comprehensive weekly data
week_data = pipeline.get_weekly_data(week=1, season=2024)

# Check data source status
status = pipeline.get_data_source_status()
print(f"Available sources: {status['enhanced_sources']}")
```

### Weather-Enhanced Analysis
```python
# Get weather for specific games
from data_sources.weather_client import WeatherClient

weather_client = WeatherClient()
gb_weather = weather_client.get_game_weather('GB', game_datetime)

# Bulk weather for all games
weather_data = weather_client.get_bulk_game_weather(games_df)
```

### Live Score Monitoring
```python
# Get live scores from multiple sources
from data_sources.espn_client import ESPNClient

espn = ESPNClient()
live_scores = espn.get_live_scores(2024, current_week)
standings = espn.get_standings(2024)
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Add OpenWeatherMap API key** for enhanced weather data (1K calls/day free)
2. **Configure odds APIs** for betting line integration
3. **Set up automated scheduling** for regular data collection

### Future Enhancements
