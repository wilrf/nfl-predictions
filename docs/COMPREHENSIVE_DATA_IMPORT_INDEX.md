## üéØ Key Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Drop 2015 Data ‚úÖ
**Decision:** Start from 2016 instead of 2015

**Rationale:**
- NGS data only available 2016+
- Injury data only available 2016+
- Snap count data only available 2016+

**Trade-off:**
- Lose: 267 games (9.7% of dataset)
- Gain: 12 additional features (NGS + injuries)

**Math:**
```
With 2015:    2,743 games √ó 42 features = 115,206 feature-observations
Without 2015: 2,476 games √ó 50 features = 123,800 feature-observations
Net gain: +7.5% more feature-observations
```

**Result:** Better model with fewer but richer data points

### 2. Skip Play-by-Play for Now ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Decision:** Don't import 432K plays immediately

**Rationale:**
- Column mismatch issue requires debugging
- Team-level EPA can be calculated from game results
- 432K √ó 396 columns = massive complexity
- Not critical for initial ML model

**Alternative:**
- Calculate team aggregates from game data
- Import later if advanced features needed

### 3. Skip Rosters Due to Library Bug ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Decision:** Don't import 363K roster records

**Rationale:**
- nfl_data_py has duplicate index bug
- Workaround exists (season-by-season) but time-consuming
- Player-level data not critical for team prediction
- Already have team aggregates via NGS, snaps, injuries

**Alternative:**
- Import season-by-season if needed
- Focus on team-level metrics first

### 4. Use SQLite Instead of PostgreSQL ‚úÖ
**Decision:** Keep SQLite for database

**Rationale:**
- Dataset size: 59 MB (well within SQLite limits of 140 TB)
- No concurrent writes needed (batch imports only)
- Simpler deployment (no server setup)
- Faster for small datasets

**When to migrate:**
- If storing raw play-by-play (432K √ó 396 columns)
- If building real-time API (concurrent access)
- If expanding to other sports (MLB/NBA/NHL)

- 4 injury features (severity, key player status)
- 6 advanced EPA features (explosive plays, efficiency)
- 6 rolling features (3-game, 5-game, EWMA)
- 4 situational features (turnover rate, red zone)

**Total:** 40-50 features ready for ML training

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for ML)

1. **Feature Engineering**
   - Aggregate NGS stats by team-week
   - Calculate injury severity scores
   - Create rolling averages (3-game, 5-game, EWMA)
   - Join all features to games table

2. **Create ML Datasets**
   - Train: 2016-2022 (70% = ~1,680 games)
   - Validation: 2023 H1 (15% = ~340 games)
   - Test: 2023 H2 - 2024 (15% = ~456 games)
   - Export to CSV for XGBoost

3. **Train Models**
   - Spread prediction model
   - Total points model
   - Win probability model

### Optional (Can Do Later)

4. **Import Optional Data** (~1.5 hours)
   - Fix play-by-play column mismatch
   - Import rosters season-by-season
   - Import depth charts and officials

5. **External Data Sources**
   - Elo ratings (538 scraping)
   - Weather API integration
   - Betting line movement (Odds API)

## üîç Validation Queries

### Check Record Counts
```sql
SELECT 'Games' as table_name, COUNT(*) as records FROM fact_games
UNION ALL
SELECT 'NGS Passing', COUNT(*) FROM fact_ngs_passing
UNION ALL
SELECT 'NGS Receiving', COUNT(*) FROM fact_ngs_receiving
UNION ALL
SELECT 'NGS Rushing', COUNT(*) FROM fact_ngs_rushing
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Injuries', COUNT(*) FROM fact_injuries
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Snap Counts', COUNT(*) FROM fact_snap_counts;
```

### Check Data Coverage
```sql
SELECT season, COUNT(*) as games
FROM fact_games
GROUP BY season
ORDER BY season;
```

### Sample NGS Data
```sql
SELECT *
FROM fact_ngs_passing
WHERE season = 2024
LIMIT 5;
```

### Check Team Dimension
```sql
SELECT team_abbr, team_name, team_division
FROM dim_teams
ORDER BY team_division, team_abbr;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Play-by-Play Column Mismatch
**Error:** "80 values for 90 columns"
**Cause:** Removed duplicate touchdown column but didn't adjust INSERT
**Fix:** See OPTIONAL_DATA_FIX_GUIDE.md - Option A (simplified) or Option B (debug)

### Issue 2: Rosters Duplicate Index
**Error:** "cannot reindex on an axis with duplicate labels"
**Cause:** nfl_data_py bug when importing multiple seasons
**Fix:** See OPTIONAL_DATA_FIX_GUIDE.md - season-by-season import

### Issue 3: Date Binding Error
**Error:** "Error binding parameter 13 - probably unsupported type"
**Cause:** Pandas Timestamp not converted to string
**Fix:** ‚úÖ Fixed - convert date_modified to string before insert

### Issue 4: Team Division CHECK Constraint
**Error:** "CHECK constraint failed: team_division"
**Cause:** Schema expected 'West' but data has 'NFC West'
**Fix:** ‚úÖ Fixed - updated CHECK constraint to include conference prefix
