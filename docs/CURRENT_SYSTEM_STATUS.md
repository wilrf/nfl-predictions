## Known Issues

### Critical

1. **Missing Playoff Games**
   - Impact: 109 games (4% of dataset) not in training
   - Risk: Model may not generalize to playoff intensity
   - Fix: Import all playoff games from 2016-2024

2. **No Closing Line Benchmark**
   - Impact: Can't assess profitability
   - Risk: High accuracy doesn't mean profitable
   - Fix: Integrate betting lines, calculate CLV

3. **Limited Feature Set**
   - Impact: Missing high-correlation features (r=0.55-0.85)
   - Risk: Underperformance vs more complete models
   - Fix: Expand to 50+ features per data plan

### Important

4. **Deprecated Library**
   - Impact: nfl_data_py no longer maintained
   - Risk: Breaking changes, security issues
   - Fix: Migrate to nflreadpy before major imports

5. **Simple Validation**
   - Impact: May be overfitting
   - Risk: Inflated performance estimates
   - Fix: Implement walk-forward validation

6. **No NGS Data**
   - Impact: Missing pressure, time to throw, separation
   - Risk: Missing 24,814 valuable records
   - Fix: Import Next Gen Stats (2016-2025)

### Minor

7. **Outdated Consolidated Files**
   - Impact: train.csv/val.csv/test.csv don't match current models
   - Risk: Confusion about training data
   - Fix: Regenerate or delete

8. **2015 NGS Gap**
   - Impact: Feature inconsistency if keeping 2015
   - Risk: Model confusion from different feature sets
   - Fix: Start from 2016 for feature parity

## System Limits

### Current Constraints

**Data Volume**:
- Games: 2,687 (could be 2,748 with playoffs)
- Data records: ~80,000 (could be 1,200,000+)
- Storage: ~51 MB (will be ~2 GB with full data)

**Feature Engineering**:
- Features: 8 (could be 50+)
- PBP utilization: 4% (using 15 of 372 columns)

- Temporal integrity: Yes (but not robust)
- Industry standard: No (need walk-forward)

### Scaling Potential

**Can Easily Handle**:
- 5x more games (10,000+ games)
- 6x more features (50+ features)
- 15x more data (1.2M+ records)
- Walk-forward validation (weekly rolling)

**Hardware Requirements** (After Full Implementation):
- RAM: 8-16 GB
- Storage: ~2-3 GB
- CPU: Modern multi-core (XGBoost benefits)
- Training time: ~2-5 minutes (still fast)

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable (Currently Met)
- ‚úÖ Models trained and operational
- ‚úÖ Web interface functional
- ‚úÖ Predictions generated
- ‚úÖ Accuracy >50% (baseline)

### Good Performance (Partially Met)
- ‚úÖ Accuracy >60% on validation
- üü° High-confidence picks >75% accurate (100% but small sample)
- ‚ùå Profitable vs closing line (not measured)
- ‚ùå Complete data coverage (missing playoffs, NGS)

### Professional Standard (Not Yet Met)
- ‚ùå 53-55% accuracy vs closing line
- ‚ùå 3-5% ROI over 100+ bets
- ‚ùå Walk-forward validation implemented
- ‚ùå 50+ features with proven correlations
- ‚ùå Complete data coverage (playoffs, NGS, injuries)
- ‚ùå CLV tracking operational

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- Current system stability (operational)
- Data availability (confirmed available)
- Model training (working well)
- Web interface (functional)

### Medium Risk üü°
- nfl_data_py deprecation (time to migrate)
- Feature overfitting with expansion (mitigation: L1/L2, feature selection)
- 2025 data completeness (use as test set only)

### High Risk üî¥
- **No closing line benchmark** - Can't assess profitability
- **Simple validation** - May be overfitting
- **Limited features** - Underperforming vs complete models
- **No playoff data** - Model may not generalize

---

## Conclusion

The NFL betting suggestions system is **operational and functional** but operating at ~7% of potential capacity. With 1.2M+ data records available and only 80K used, expanding to 50+ features and implementing professional-grade validation will likely yield 5-10% accuracy improvement and establish true profitability benchmarks.

**Current Status**: üü° Working but Limited
**Potential**: üü¢ Professional-Grade Achievable
**Timeline**: 4 weeks to full implementation
**Next Action**: Begin playoff import and feature expansion per [COMPLETE_2016_2025_DATA_PLAN.md](./COMPLETE_2016_2025_DATA_PLAN.md)
