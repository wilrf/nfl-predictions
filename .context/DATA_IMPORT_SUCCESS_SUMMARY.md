## ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT YET IMPORTED (Due to Library Issues)

| Data Source | Records | Reason |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Play-by-play | ~432,000 | Column mismatch (needs schema fix) |
| Rosters | ~363,000 | nfl_data_py library bug (duplicate index) |
| Depth Charts | ~335,000 | Skipped (depends on rosters) |
| Officials | ~17,000 | Skipped (low priority) |

**Note:** These can be imported later after fixing the schema/library issues, or may not be needed for initial ML training.

---

## üîß Issues Fixed During Import

### 1. Schema Issues
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate `touchdown` column from fact_plays
- ‚úÖ Fixed `team_division` CHECK constraint (added conference prefix)
- ‚úÖ Made `team_abbr` nullable in NGS tables (some records have NULL team)

### 2. Import Script Issues
- ‚úÖ Fixed column count mismatch (90 columns, needed 90 placeholders)
- ‚úÖ Fixed `date_modified` binding error (converted pandas Timestamp to string)
- ‚úÖ Added proper NULL handling for all optional fields

### 3. nfl_data_py Library Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `import_weekly_rosters()` has duplicate index bug when importing multiple seasons
  - **Workaround:** Import rosters one season at a time
  - **Alternative:** Skip rosters for now (not critical for initial ML model)

## üìà Features Now Available for ML Training

### Tier 1 Features (High Correlation with Spread)
From the imported data, you can now engineer:

1. **EPA-based features** (from games):
   - Team offensive/defensive EPA (need to calculate from schedule data)

2. **NGS QB features** (5,328 records):
   - `home_cpoe`, `away_cpoe` - Completion % above expected
   - `home_time_to_throw`, `away_time_to_throw` - Pressure handling

3. **NGS WR features** (13,329 records):
   - `home_avg_separation`, `away_avg_separation` - Receiver quality

4. **Injury impact features** (49,488 records):
   - `home_key_injuries`, `away_key_injuries` - QB/RB/WR out
   - `home_injury_severity`, `away_injury_severity` - Weighted score

5. **Snap count features** (224,078 records):
   - `home_rotation_stability`, `away_rotation_stability` - Lineup consistency

### Total Estimated Features: 40-50

**Current (from existing CSV):** 20 features
**New (from imported data):** 20-30 features
**Total:** 40-50 features for ML training

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for ML Training)
1. **Calculate Team EPA Stats**
   - Aggregate game-level EPA from schedule data
   - Create `agg_team_epa_stats` table
   - Calculate offensive/defensive EPA per game

2. **Engineer NGS Features**
   - Aggregate NGS stats by team-week
   - Join to games table
   - Create rolling averages (last 3 games, last 5 games)

3. **Calculate Injury Scores**
   - Weight by position (QB=5, RB/WR=2, DEF=1)
   - Weight by status (Out=3, Doubtful=2, Questionable=1)
   - Create team-week injury severity scores

4. **Generate ML Training Dataset**
   - Combine all features into single table
   - Create train/val/test splits
   - Export to CSV for XGBoost

### Optional (Can Do Later)
5. Fix play-by-play schema and import (~432K plays)
6. Import rosters season-by-season (work around library bug)
7. Import depth charts and officials data

## üìÇ Files & Locations

### Database
- **Location:** `database/nfl_comprehensive.db`
- **Size:** 59 MB
- **Backup:** `database/backups/nfl_betting_backup_*.db`

### Logs
- **Import Log:** `logs/bulk_import_SUCCESS.log`
- **Error Details:** Check logs for any warnings

### Schema
- **Schema File:** `database/comprehensive_schema.sql`
- **Tables:** 23 tables (4 dimension, 11 fact, 3 aggregation, 5 betting)

---

## üéì Key Decisions Made

### 1. Drop 2015 Data ‚úÖ
- **Reason:** NGS data only available 2016+
- **Trade-off:** Lost 267 games, gained 12 features
- **Result:** 9.7% fewer games, but 7.5% more feature-observations

### 2. Skip Play-by-Play for Now ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Reason:** 432K rows with 396 columns = complex schema
- **Alternative:** Can calculate team-level EPA from schedule/game data
- **Decision:** Import later if needed for advanced features

### 3. Skip Rosters Due to Library Bug ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Reason:** nfl_data_py has duplicate index error
- **Workaround:** Import season-by-season or skip entirely
- **Impact:** Low - player rosters not critical for team-level prediction
