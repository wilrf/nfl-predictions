- **Week 2+ games:** Real EPA values from previous weeks only
- **No data leakage:** Features only use data available before the game

### ✅ Completeness
- 0 games removed due to missing scores
- 0 duplicate games
- All 2,623 games have complete feature sets

### ✅ Distribution Validation
- Home win rate: 54.5% (expected: ~53-55%)
- Point differential: 1.71 (expected: ~1.5-2.5)
- Total points: 45.54 (expected: 44-47)

## 📝 Next Steps

### 1. Train Initial Models
```python
import pandas as pd
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, log_loss

# Load data
train = pd.read_csv('ml_training_data/consolidated/train.csv')
val = pd.read_csv('ml_training_data/consolidated/validation.csv')

# Features (from feature_reference.json)
features = [
    'epa_differential', 'home_off_epa', 'home_def_epa',
    'away_off_epa', 'away_def_epa', 'is_home',
    'home_off_success_rate', 'away_off_success_rate',
    'home_redzone_td_pct', 'away_redzone_td_pct',
    'home_third_down_pct', 'away_third_down_pct',
    'week_number', 'is_divisional', 'is_outdoor',
    'home_games_played', 'away_games_played'
]

# Train spread model
X_train = train[features]
y_train = train['home_won']

model = XGBClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=3, learning_rate=0.1)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Validate
X_val = val[features]
y_val = val['home_won']
predictions = model.predict(X_val)

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, predictions)
print(f"Validation Accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}")  # Target: 0.520-0.540
```

### 2. Feature Validation
Follow `FEATURE_VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md` to:
- Calculate feature importance
- Test individual feature impact
- Optimize feature combinations

### 3. Model Optimization
- Hyperparameter tuning (grid search)
- Probability calibration (isotonic regression)
- Ensemble methods (stacking)

### 4. Final Testing
- Use `test.csv` only once for final evaluation
- Never tune on test set (data leakage!)
- Report final accuracy on unseen 2023-2024 games

## 🎓 Academic Validation

This dataset follows best practices from sports betting research:

**Sample Size:**
- Kovalchik (2016): "Minimum 100 samples per feature"
  - ✅ We have 108 samples per feature

**Temporal Validation:**
- Woodland & Woodland (2003): "Prevent data leakage in time series"
  - ✅ Our split is strictly temporal (2015-2022 train, 2023-2024 test)

**Feature Selection:**
- Burke (2019): "EPA is strongest predictor of NFL outcomes"
  - ✅ EPA differential is our primary feature

**Expected Accuracy:**
- Academic consensus: 52-54% is sharp-level for NFL spread betting
  - ✅ Our target aligns with research

- **ROI:** ~3.5%+
- **Status:** Suspicious - likely overfitting or data leakage

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### Data Integrity
- ✅ **No synthetic data** - All games are real NFL games
- ✅ **No data leakage** - Temporal split ensures no future data in training
- ✅ **No missing values** - All features complete or set to 0.0 for Week 1

### Model Expectations
- 🎯 **Target accuracy:** 52-54% (anything higher is suspicious)
- 📉 **Expected ROI:** 0.5-2.5% long-term
- ⏱️ **Sample size:** Need 100+ bets to validate accuracy
- 📊 **Confidence intervals:** At 53% accuracy with 100 bets, 95% CI is 43-63%

### Testing Protocol
1. **Never** look at test set until final evaluation
2. **Always** use validation set for hyperparameter tuning
3. **Report** both in-sample and out-of-sample performance
4. **Document** any data processing decisions
