## Key API Differences

| Aspect | nfl_data_py (Current) | nflreadpy (Target) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Python Version | 3.6+ | **3.10+** ⚠️ |
| Data Format | pandas DataFrame | Polars DataFrame |
| Import Pattern | `import nfl_data_py as nfl` | `import nflreadpy as nfl` |
| Function Names | `import_schedules()` | `load_schedules()` |
| Function Names | `import_pbp_data()` | `load_pbp()` |
| Function Names | `import_weekly_data()` | `load_player_stats()` |
| Caching | Basic | Intelligent built-in |
| Performance | Good | Excellent (Polars) |
| Maintenance | ❌ Deprecated | ✅ Active |

### Example Code Migration

**Before (nfl_data_py):**
```python
import nfl_data_py as nfl
schedule = nfl.import_schedules([2024])
pbp = nfl.import_pbp_data([2024])
# Already pandas DataFrames
```

**After (nflreadpy):**
```python
import nflreadpy as nfl
schedule = nfl.load_schedules([2024])
pbp = nfl.load_pbp([2024])
# Convert Polars to pandas for compatibility
schedule = schedule.to_pandas()
pbp = pbp.to_pandas()
```

- Update requirements: 5 min
- Migrate `nfl_data_fetcher.py`: 45 min (most complex)
- Migrate remaining files: 30 min
- Testing: 30 min
- Buffer for issues: 15 min

---

## Current Workaround

**Continue using nfl_data_py with Python 3.9.6:**

```python
# This still works perfectly
import nfl_data_py as nfl

# All current functionality available
schedule = nfl.import_schedules([2024])  # Returns pandas
pbp = nfl.import_pbp_data([2024])        # Returns pandas
weekly = nfl.import_weekly_data([2024])  # Returns pandas
injuries = nfl.import_injuries([2024])   # Returns pandas
ngs_passing = nfl.import_ngs_data('passing', [2024])  # Returns pandas
```

**Known limitations while using nfl_data_py:**
- No new features will be added
- Security updates unlikely
- May break with future pandas 3.0 or numpy 2.0
- Community support declining
- Data freshness ends at 2024 season (may continue working for 2025)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Current system stability (working fine)
- Data availability (confirmed through 2024)
- No immediate breakage expected
- Migration path well-documented

### Medium Risk 🟡
- Future pandas/numpy compatibility (monitor)
- Community support declining (fewer Stack Overflow answers)
- Data freshness for 2025+ seasons (may still work)

### High Risk 🔴
- None currently (nfl_data_py still functional)

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor for compatibility warnings
- Test regularly with current pandas/numpy versions
- Plan Python upgrade during off-season (Feb-July)
- Keep migration guide updated

---

## Testing & Validation

### Verified Current Functionality
```bash
# Confirmed nfl_data_py v0.3.2 installed
python3 -m pip list | grep nfl_data_py
# nfl_data_py         0.3.2

# Confirmed Python version
python3 --version
# Python 3.9.6

# Confirmed nflreadpy cannot install
python3 -m pip install nflreadpy
# ERROR: Requires-Python >=3.10
```

### System Still Functional
- All import scripts working
- Data fetching operational
- Models training successfully
- Web interface running
- No compatibility errors
