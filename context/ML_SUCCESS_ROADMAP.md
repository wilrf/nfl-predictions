Each pillar is necessary. All three together = success.

---

## Phase 1: Massive Data Import (Week 1)

### What We're Getting:
- **2,700 games** (2015-2024) = Professional-grade dataset
- **~1.3M plays** with EPA data
- **Every snap, every yard, every turnover**

### Why This Works:

**Academic Evidence:**
- Sharp bettors use 2,000+ games minimum
- 2,700 games = 207 samples per feature (well above 100 minimum)
- Modern era data (consistent rules, parity)

### Deliverable:
```
✅ Supabase Tables Populated:
- games: 2,700 rows
- team_epa_stats: ~15,000 rows (by team per week)
- pbp_data: 1.3M plays (cached locally, not in Supabase)
- game_features: 2,700 rows (calculated features)
```

### Timeline: 10 hours
- Build importer: 6 hours
- Run import: 4 hours
- Validate: included

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] 2,700 games in Supabase
- [ ] EPA data calculated correctly
- [ ] No missing values in critical fields
- [ ] Temporal ordering validated (no future data leakage)

---

## Phase 2: Feature Validation (Week 2)

### What We're Testing:
**30 candidate features → 15 proven features**

### The Scientific Method:

```
Step 1: Calculate All Features (8 hours)
├── EPA-based (8 features)
├── Scoring efficiency (6 features)
├── Situational (8 features)
└── Recent performance (8 features)

Step 2: Univariate Testing (2 hours)
├── Correlation with point differential
├── P-value significance
└── Keep features with |corr| > 0.10 and p < 0.01

Step 3: XGBoost Feature Importance (3 hours)
├── Train on all features
├── Rank by importance
└── Keep top 20

Step 4: Ablation Testing (4 hours)
├── Remove one feature at a time
├── Measure accuracy drop
└── Keep features with >0.5% impact

Step 5: Temporal Validation (3 hours)
├── Test features across seasons
├── Ensure stability
└── Drop unstable features
```

### Expected Result:

**Top 5 Features (80% of signal):**
1. EPA differential
2. Recent performance (last 3 games)
3. Rest advantage
4. Turnover differential
5. Home field advantage

**Next 10 Features (18% of signal):**
6-15: Red zone %, third down %, scoring efficiency, etc.

**Remaining features:** Noise (2% of signal, drop them)

### Timeline: 20 hours
- Feature calculation: 8 hours
- Validation testing: 10 hours
- Documentation: 2 hours

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] 15-20 features selected
- [ ] All features p-value < 0.01
- [ ] All features temporally stable
- [ ] Feature importance documented
- [ ] Baseline model hits 50%+ with just these features

---

## Phase 3: ML Training (Week 3-4)

### The Training Strategy:

**Step 1: Data Split (Temporal)**
```
2015-2021: Training (1,900 games = 70%)
2022-2023: Validation (540 games = 20%)
2024:      Test (270 games = 10%)
```

**Critical:** Never train on future data!

### Step 2: Baseline Model (4 hours)

```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, log_loss

# Start simple
baseline = XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=3,
    learning_rate=0.1
)

baseline.fit(X_train, y_train)
baseline_acc = baseline.score(X_val, y_val)

print(f"Baseline accuracy: {baseline_acc:.1%}")
```

**Expected:** 50-51% (better than coin flip)

**Decision Point:**
- If <50%: Features don't work, back to Phase 2
- If 50-51%: Good, proceed to tuning
- If >51%: Excellent, proceed to tuning

### Step 3: Hyperparameter Tuning (8 hours)

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300, 500],
    'max_depth': [3, 4, 5, 6],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1],
    'subsample': [0.7, 0.8, 0.9],
    'colsample_bytree': [0.7, 0.8, 0.9]
}

# This takes time (8 hours total)
grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    XGBClassifier(),
    param_grid,
    cv=5,
    scoring='neg_log_loss',
    n_jobs=-1
)

grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_

print(f"Best params: {grid_search.best_params_}")
print(f"Validation accuracy: {best_model.score(X_val, y_val):.1%}")
```

**Expected gain:** +1-2% accuracy (now at 51-53%)

### Step 4: Probability Calibration (4 hours)

```python
from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV

# Calibrate on validation set
calibrated = CalibratedClassifierCV(
    best_model,
    method='isotonic',
    cv='prefit'
)

calibrated.fit(X_val, y_val)

# Test calibration
from sklearn.calibration import calibration_curve

prob_true, prob_pred = calibration_curve(
    y_test, calibrated.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1], n_bins=10
)

# Should be close to diagonal
calibration_error = np.mean(np.abs(prob_true - prob_pred))
print(f"Calibration error: {calibration_error:.3f}")
```

**Goal:** Calibration error < 0.10

### Step 5: Ensemble Methods (8 hours)

If single model at 51-52%, boost with ensemble:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier

# Ensemble of diverse models
ensemble = VotingClassifier([
    ('xgb', best_xgb_model),
    ('lgbm', LGBMClassifier(**best_lgbm_params)),
    ('lr', LogisticRegression(C=0.1))
], voting='soft')

ensemble.fit(X_train, y_train)
ensemble_acc = ensemble.score(X_test, y_test)

print(f"Ensemble accuracy: {ensemble_acc:.1%}")
```

**Expected gain:** +0.5-1% (now at 52-54%)

### Timeline: 30 hours
- Baseline: 4 hours
- Hyperparameter tuning: 8 hours
- Calibration: 4 hours
- Ensemble: 8 hours
- Testing & validation: 4 hours
- Documentation: 2 hours

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Test set accuracy ≥52%
- [ ] Calibration error <0.10
- [ ] Temporally validated (works on 2024 data)
- [ ] Models saved (.pkl files)
- [ ] Performance documented

- Win rate: 52%
- Breakeven: 52.38% (with -110 odds)
- **Profit margin:** -0.38% (basically breakeven)
- **ROI:** ~0% (not worth it)

**53% Accuracy:**
- Win rate: 53%
- **Profit margin:** +0.62%
- **ROI:** ~1-2% long-term
- **Verdict:** Marginally profitable

**54% Accuracy:**
- Win rate: 54%
- **Profit margin:** +1.62%
- **ROI:** ~3-5% long-term
- **Verdict:** Solidly profitable (sharp level)

### Reality Check:

**Industry benchmarks:**
- 52.38%: Breakeven
- 53-54%: Good sharp bettor
- 54-55%: Elite sharp bettor
- 55%+: Best in world (rare, unsustainable)

**Our target: 52-54% is realistic and profitable**

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### If Models Hit Only 50-52%:

**Option 1: Add More Data**
- Expand to 2010-2024 (4,000 games)
- Expected gain: +0.5-1%
- Timeline: +4 hours import + retrain

**Option 2: Better Features**
- Add injuries (QB only)
- Add coaching impact
- Add weather (for totals)
- Timeline: +8 hours

**Option 3: Ensemble Harder**
- Add neural network
- Add gradient boosting
- Stacking ensemble
- Timeline: +8 hours

### If Models Hit 48-50%:

**Problem:** Features not predictive enough
**Solution:**
1. Re-validate features (Phase 2)
2. Add 2010-2014 data (older but more volume)
3. Consider alternative targets (point differential vs binary outcome)
4. Might need domain expert consultation
