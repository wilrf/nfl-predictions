# Data Validation Framework

A scientifically rigorous, market-aware approach to validate which data sources deliver actual betting value. This framework combines statistical significance testing with practical betting performance metrics while accounting for market efficiency and temporal stability.

## Overview

This framework provides a comprehensive 5-phase validation process that ensures development time is invested only in data sources that provide statistically significant, practically meaningful, and temporally stable betting value.

## The 5-Phase Framework

### Phase 1: Enhanced Statistical Foundation
**Prevent false discoveries through insufficient data**

- **Sample Size Validation & Power Analysis**: Ensures sufficient data before testing
- **Leak-Free Cross-Validation**: Prevents temporal data leakage that invalidates results
- **Statistical Significance Testing**: Rigorous hypothesis testing with multiple comparison corrections
- **Effect Size Analysis**: Practical significance beyond statistical significance

**Key Features:**
- Minimum sample size requirements by data source type
- Temporal stratification to prevent information leakage
- Bonferroni correction for multiple testing
- Statistical power calculation

### Phase 2: Market-Aware Validation
**Determine if markets already price in your information**

- **Market Efficiency Testing**: Test if markets already incorporate information
- **Kelly Criterion Simulation**: Practical betting performance analysis
- **Interaction Effect Discovery**: Find synergistic effects between data sources
- **ROI Exploitability Analysis**: Determine actual betting value

**Key Features:**
- Implied probability conversion from predictions and odds
- Kelly betting simulation with risk management
- Market efficiency scoring (0-1 scale)
- Cross-feature interaction testing

### Phase 3: Temporal Stability Analysis
**Ensure findings are reliable across time periods**

- **Year-over-Year Consistency Testing**: Validate feature reliability across seasons
- **Feature Decay Detection**: Identify declining predictive power
- **Seasonal Pattern Analysis**: Understand within-season performance
- **Regime Change Detection**: Identify structural breaks in performance

**Key Features:**
- Reliability scoring (0-1 scale) with classification tiers
- Coefficient of variation stability measures
- Trend analysis with statistical significance
- Autocorrelation analysis for consistency

### Phase 4: Prioritized Implementation Strategy
**Tier-based testing schedule and risk-adjusted decisions**

- **Tier-Based Testing**: Systematic approach by expected value
  - **Tier 1**: Highest expected value (EPA metrics, key injuries)
  - **Tier 2**: Medium expected value (weather, referee tendencies)
  - **Tier 3**: Experimental (NGS advanced metrics)
- **Risk-Adjusted Decision Framework**: Conservative ROI estimation
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Concrete timeline and resource allocation

**Key Features:**
- 4-week structured testing schedule
- Risk-adjusted ROI calculation (weighted toward downside)
- Implementation cost analysis
- Monitoring requirements by decision type

### Phase 5: Continuous Monitoring Framework
**Performance decay detection and ongoing feature health**

- **Performance Decay Detection**: Alert when features lose predictive power
- **Health Dashboard**: Real-time system health monitoring
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual performance patterns
- **Correlation Degradation Analysis**: Monitor feature relevance over time

**Key Features:**
- Rolling window performance analysis
- Three-tier alert system (normal/warning/critical)
- Feature health scoring and rankings
- Executive summary reporting

## Key Design Principles

1. **FAIL FAST**: Stop at first phase that doesn't meet criteria
2. **Scientific Rigor**: Statistical significance with practical meaning
3. **Market Awareness**: Account for market efficiency
4. **Temporal Stability**: Ensure reliability across time
5. **Risk Management**: Conservative estimates and monitoring
6. **Actionable Results**: Clear recommendations with timelines

## Dependencies

### Required
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scipy`

### Optional (for full ML functionality)
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`

### Testing
- `pytest`

## Framework Guarantees

This framework guarantees you invest development time only in data sources that provide:

✅ **Statistically significant improvements** (Phase 1)
✅ **Practically meaningful effect sizes** (Phase 1)
✅ **Market exploitability** (not already priced in) (Phase 2)
✅ **Temporal stability** across seasons (Phase 3)
✅ **Risk-adjusted positive ROI** (Phase 4)
✅ **Ongoing reliability monitoring** (Phase 5)

By following this systematic approach, you avoid wasted effort on features that markets already price efficiently or that show inconsistent predictive power over time.
